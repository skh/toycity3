1. How long did you spend working on this project?
About 4-6 hours.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Understanding how to use class attributes and methods in Ruby.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
- Returning items / cancelling transactions -- every store has to be able to handle that.
- Added attribute 'brand' to Product, and the ability to find by brand

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I still don't think I'm writing idiomatic Ruby, so while it works, my code could probably be nicer and more elegant.
